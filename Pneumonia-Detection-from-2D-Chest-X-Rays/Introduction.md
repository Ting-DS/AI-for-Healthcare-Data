# 2D Medical Image Classification: Pneumonia Detection
This repository contains a cap-stone project for the Udacity "Applying AI to 2D Medical Imaging Data" course, part of the AI for Healthcare Nanodegree program.

# Introduction
The application of deep learning in medical image analysis can effectively assist doctors in disease diagnosis, reduce labor costs, and optimize clinical analysis processes.

In this project, I will analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify given chest X-ray images to determine the presence of pneumonia. The project aims to develop a model capable of predicting the presence of pneumonia with the accuracy level of a human radiologist. The ultimate goal is to prepare a submission for 510(k) clearance as a medical device software to the FDA. In addition to model development, the submission preparation will include model description, data introduction, and a validation plan compliant with FDA standards.

# Data Source
The data comes from 112,000 chest X-rays with disease labels obtained from 30,000 patients publicly available from the NIH Clinical Center. Clinical labels for medical images were extracted from corresponding radiology reports.

# Analysis
## Exploratory Data Analysis
- perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
- establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
- extract images from a DICOM dataset
## Build and Training CNN Model
## Clinical Workflow Integration
- translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
## FDA Preparation
- plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval
